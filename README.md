<h4 align="center">wisely add "end" in Ruby, Lua, Vimscript, etc.</h4>

# Quick Start

```lua
require('nvim-treesitter.configs').setup {
    endwise = {
        enable = true,
    },
}
```

This is a simple plugin that helps to end certain structures automatically. In Ruby, this means adding end after if, do, def, etc.

**Supported Languages**: *Ruby*, *Lua*, *Vimscript*, *Julia (community-maintained)*

# Additional Language Support

Please open an issue for new languages, right now I'm open PRs but I won't be implementing other languages myself (except for maybe shell script). See https://github.com/RRethy/nvim-treesitter-endwise/issues/2#issuecomment-1019574925 for more information on adding support for a new language.

# Credit

This is just a rewrite of https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise to leverage Treesitter so it can be more accurate and work without having to run Neovim's slow regex based highlighting along with nvim-treesitter highlighting.
